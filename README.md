# factorio-tools

This repository contains various tools I've made to function with [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/), a production chain game by Wube. 

- Scripts in desync-parsing/ are for reading through Factorio debug logs when players desync.
- Scripts in script-tools/ should be self-evident.
